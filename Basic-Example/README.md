# Bandyer SDK Basic Example

This sample app is going to show you how the Bandyer SDK should be configured, initialized, and how you can interact with it.

## Quickstart

1. Obtain a Mobile API key
2. Install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started) .
3. In terminal, run the `pod install` command
4. Open the project in Xcode 
5. Add `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` keys to the app's Info.plist file
6. Replace "api key" placeholders in the code 
7. Replace the app bundle identifier and set up code signing if you want to run the example on a real device.


## Caveats

This app uses fake users fetched from our backend system. We provide access to those user through a REST api which requires another set of access keys. If your backend system already provides Bandyer "user alias" for your users, then you should modify the app in order to fetch users information from you backend system instead of ours.
